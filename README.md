# PanckaceSwapAPI
[GetPrice COmplicated]
(https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-info-api/blob/develop/v2-documentation.md)

All Original PancackeSwap Endpoint Are Not deprecated but manny issues whit other token price some token return exception and whit other word something what u not wana have 
Here is Technology lover comes in this class cost me days to make as im working on Web3 project, There is no active replly from developers and swap team , from here i send a challenge to the team im here to remake your API in C# Language , U like it Hit me  now we have to read smart contract and see how pancackeswap calculate price after reading solidity this is result in C# Language , Here is global Idea , This class is part of my CryptoParty Prioject You Are free to use it.
If you oroginal link pamcakeswap works whit 4 API endpoint Am woking to remake them and publish here , importent one was to get price which i made public nexr are coming soon ,


here is some intresting function in contract

    function getAmountOut(uint amountIn, uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut) internal pure returns (uint amountOut) {
        require(amountIn > 0, 'PancakeLibrary: INSUFFICIENT_INPUT_AMOUNT');
        require(reserveIn > 0 && reserveOut > 0, 'PancakeLibrary: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
        uint amountInWithFee = amountIn.mul(9975);
        uint numerator = amountInWithFee.mul(reserveOut);
        uint denominator = reserveIn.mul(10000).add(amountInWithFee);
        amountOut = numerator / denominator;
    }

    // given an output amount of an asset and pair reserves, returns a required input amount of the other asset
    function getAmountIn(uint amountOut, uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut) internal pure returns (uint amountIn) {
        require(amountOut > 0, 'PancakeLibrary: INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT');
        require(reserveIn > 0 && reserveOut > 0, 'PancakeLibrary: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
        uint numerator = reserveIn.mul(amountOut).mul(10000);
        uint denominator = reserveOut.sub(amountOut).mul(9975);
        amountIn = (numerator / denominator).add(1);
    }

    // performs chained getAmountOut calculations on any number of pairs
    function getAmountsOut(address factory, uint amountIn, address[] memory path) internal view returns (uint[] memory amounts) {
        require(path.length >= 2, 'PancakeLibrary: INVALID_PATH');
        amounts = new uint[](path.length);
        amounts[0] = amountIn;
        for (uint i; i < path.length - 1; i++) {
            (uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut) = getReserves(factory, path[i], path[i + 1]);
            amounts[i + 1] = getAmountOut(amounts[i], reserveIn, reserveOut);
        }
    }

    // performs chained getAmountIn calculations on any number of pairs
    function getAmountsIn(address factory, uint amountOut, address[] memory path) internal view returns (uint[] memory amounts) {
        require(path.length >= 2, 'PancakeLibrary: INVALID_PATH');
        amounts = new uint[](path.length);
        amounts[amounts.length - 1] = amountOut;
        for (uint i = path.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            (uint reserveIn, uint reserveOut) = getReserves(factory, path[i - 1], path[i]);
            amounts[i - 1] = getAmountIn(amounts[i], reserveIn, reserveOut);
        }
    }
